\# Python Basics



This repository contains my daily Python practice as part of my backend development journey.



\## Concepts Covered

\- Variables

\- Data Types

\- Basic Input and Output



\## Files

\- day1\_basics.py – Demonstrates variables and data types



\## How to Run

1\. Make sure Python is installed

2\. Open terminal in project folder

3\. Run:

   ```bash

   python day1\_basics.py



Goal

Build strong Python fundamentals before moving to Django and backend development.







📘 Day 2: User Input \& Conditional Logic (Python)

📌 Topics Covered



On Day 2, I practiced working with user input and decision-making logic in Python.



Concepts learned and applied:



input() function



Type casting (int)



Conditional statements (if, elif, else)



Relational operators (>=, <)



Logical flow for real-world problems



🧠 Problem Description



The program:



Takes user name and age as input



Checks whether the user is:



Eligible to vote



Falls under the working category



This simulates a real-life decision-based program, commonly used in backend logic.



🧪 Logic Used



Voting eligibility: age ≥ 18



Working category: age ≥ 18 and ≤ 60

## Day 3 – Loops & Input Validation

### Concepts Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- Input validation using loops
- Controlling program flow

### Learning Outcome
Learned how backend systems repeatedly validate user input and control execution flow.
